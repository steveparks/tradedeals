      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e">Financial Times conducted research</a> that showed that the UK will have to negotiate at least 759 separate treaties:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>295 Trade Agreements - including the bilateral ones listed above PLUS other multilateral agreements</li>
      <li>202 Regulatory Cooperation Agreements - everything from anti-trust to data sharing</li>
      <li>69 Fisheries Agreements - access to waters, protection of stocks</li>
      <li>65 Transport Agreements</li>
      <li>49 Customs Agreements</li>
      <li>45 Nuclear Agreements</li>
      <li>34 Agriculture Agreements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Out of those 759+ agreements that will be needed, the UK government has 0 and has started formal talks with 0 nations. This site will update as trade deals are announced.</p>
      <h2>Brexit spells disaster for the UK, and our government has failed to prepare. It is our patriotic duty to protect the UK by stopping Brexit.</h2>
