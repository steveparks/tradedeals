      <h1>And this is just the start...</h1>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e">Financial Times conducted research</a> that showed that the UK will have to negotiate at least 759 separate treaties:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>295 Trade Agreements - including the bilateral ones listed above PLUS other multilateral agreements</li>
      <li>202 Regulatory Cooperation Agreements - everything from anti-trust to data sharing</li>
      <li>69 Fisheries Agreements - access to waters, protection of stocks</li>
      <li>65 Transport Agreements</li>
      <li>49 Customs Agreements</li>
      <li>45 Nuclear Agreements</li>
      <li>34 Agriculture Agreements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Out of those 759+ agreements that will be needed, the UK government has the equivalent of 3.5 by our judgment. Yet we were already supposed to have left!</p>
      <h2>Brexit spells disaster for the UK, and our government has failed to prepare. It is our patriotic duty to protect the UK by stopping Brexit.</h2>
      <p>So what can you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/cases/?filter=brexit">There are some public interest legal cases that you can support</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584">Sign the petition to revoke Article 50, and tell your friends</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.writetothem.com/">Write to your MP to ask them to support revoking Article 50 and a Peoples Vote</a>.</li>
        <li>Although it can be hard, do follow the news (from reputable sources).</li>
        <li>Talk to family and friends about it to ensure people know the reality of what Brexit is going to mean. Public opinion is shifting, and we can all help that trend continue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are good people out there doing good work. You are not alone, and you can be part of the movement to Stop Brexit or at least reduce its harmful impact.</p>
